# Javascript Design Patterns

## 1. Functions as first-class citizens - main1.js

Functions can be treated like a variable, they can be passed as arguments to other functions. It can be assigned as a value to a variable or even return in a function.

## 2. Callback - main2.js

Is function that is called iside of another function.

## 3. Creational Patterns

Control the creation process of an object

- Prototype Class
- Constructor
- Singleton
- Factory
- Abstract factory

### 3.1 Prototype Class Pattern - main3.js

Allow us to define a blueprint for a specific type of item, and then reuse it by creating a new object from that class

### 3.2 Constructor Pattern - main4.js

Is one step further from the class pattern where we leverage a class created to create an extended class from it

### 3.3 Singleton Pattern - main5.js

Prevents our classes from creating more than one instance of the class

### 3.4 Factory Pattern - main6.js
